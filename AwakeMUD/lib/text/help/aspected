"ASPECTED MAGICIAN"

There are five types of aspected magicians. Elementalists who cast 
spells and conjure elementals related only to their element. Sorcerers 
who cast all spells but summon no spirits. Conjurers who conjure
spirits but cast no spells. 

Shamanists who can both cast spells and summon spirits, but only those
related to their totem. For example Cat shamans cast only illusion 
spells and summon only city spirits.

And somatic adepts also called physical adepts or just adepts.
Elementalists, conjurers, and shamanists can astrally percieve but not
astral travel. Adepts may buy the astral perception power but it still 
does not allow them to astral travel.
