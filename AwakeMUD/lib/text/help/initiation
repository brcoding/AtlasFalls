INITIATION INITIATE

Usage: ^gINITIATE^n

Initiation is a magician's way of advancement, whether the magician
be a shaman, mage, or adept.  When your character is initiated, its
magic rating increases by one point.

When you reach the requirements for an initiation you can use the
^WINITIATE^N command to enter the initiation menu and choose how you wish
to spend your initiation. You can either increase your magic and gain
a metamagic technique, increase your magic and change your astral
signature, or shed any gaes you currently have.

The cost for an initiation is 5 plus the desired grade times 3. So
if you wished to initiate to grade 2 it would cost you (5+2)*3=21.

There is also an additional cost of nuyen and a requirement of TKE

Requirements are:

            TKE      NUYEN
Grade 1:      0      50000
  "   2:    100      75000
  "   3:    200     125000
  "   4:    400     225000
  "   5:    600     425000
  "  6+:   +200     825000
