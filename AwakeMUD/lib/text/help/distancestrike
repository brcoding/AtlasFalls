"DISTANCE STRIKE"

This allows the adept to strike from a distance, meaning they don't
have to close as much distance to attack in hand to hand combat.
This does not allow the adept to negate closing all together it just 
reduces the amount of distance they need to close. It works at a range 
equal to the user's magic rating in meters.
