TIME

Usage: ^gTIME^n

Gives you the current game time.  Your initial reaction to the output of
this command may be one of surprise, but you'll get used to it.  You'll
have to, at any rate, since certain things in the game depend on this
particular notion of time; the opening hours of the ^Wshops^n, for example.
1 hour of mud time is equal to 2 minutes of real time.
