PAYDATA

Paydata is a type of file that is of value to someone. Generally
they are sold to data fences who then ship the data on to the people
who want it. Once downloaded paydata starts to lose its value, the
longer you keep it around the less it will be worth. No one wants old
data. Also, the amount of data on the market affects the price. Every
piece of paydata sold lowers the price of all paydata from the same
security rated hosts for a temporary time.
