PRAIRIE DOG

Prairie Dog is playful, fun-loving and friendly. He is not
naive, however, always keeping an eye out for danger. He
relies on hisfamily and friends to help him as he helps
them. Prairie Dog shamans pride themselves on making friends
with neighbours and building a support network. They always
know multiple waysof getting somewhere and rarely follow the
same route twice in a row.
