KILLER

The killer flag is tripped whenever you make a hostile action
against another player who is not flagged PK or you are not
flagged PK when taking the hostile action.

Hostile actions include:
     o Initiating Combat
     o Stray Bullets
     o Casting Offensive Spells
     o Attacking Player Owned Vehicles
     o Putting out contracts on people
     o Harrassing/tricking people into flagging PK

There are numerous penalties also for having this flag. Any
player may kill you without penalty, even those not flagged
PK. Also you will be unable to take any runs from NPC johnsons.
