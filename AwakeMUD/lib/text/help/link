LINK UNLINK

Usage: ^gLINK <skillsoft number>^n
       ^gUNLINK <skillsoft number>^n

This command is used to load skillsofts from headware memory and
make them available for use. It requires the use of a knowsoft link for
knowsofts or skillwires for activesofts and headware memory. It works the 
same way as a chipjack but doesn't require the chip to be inserted.
