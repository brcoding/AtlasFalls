"BIOWARE INDEX"

Bioware Index is a measure of how much bioware you currently
have implanted in your body. If you are an awakened character
your magic is reduced by half of your bioware index. Also, if
your bioware index is greater than your essence index you will
experience numerous drawbacks. These include prolonged healing
periods, susceptibility to disease and pathogens, and lower
overflow.
