TURTLE

Turtle exits in harmony with his environment. Though fertile,
he feels little responsibility towards his young. Turtle sees
survival as a privilege to be earned. He finds combat an alien
concept and prefers to hide from danger, relying on his hard
shell to protect him. Turtle shamsn feel little urge to protect
others, even when doing so poses no danger to them. Turtle
shamans tend to go through life in a detached state, observing
things rather than becoming involved. This innate lack of
curiosity often makes it difficult to rouse them to action.
