AMMUNITION AMMO

There are 6 major types of ammunition in Shadowrun. Normal
ammunition is just that, it has no special effects. The others
are:

 o APDS (Armour Piercing Discarding Sabot)
   APDS is used to blast through heavily armoured enemies. It
   halves their ballistic armour rating.
 
 o Explosive
   Explosive rounds are solid slugs that are designed to fragment
   once they hit their target. This increases the Power by 1.

 o EX (Enhanced eXplosive)
   EX is a more damaging version of the Explosive ammunition. It
   increases the Power by 2.

 o Flechette
   Flechette ammunition fragments as it leaves the barrel, causing
   massive damage to unarmoured opponents, but is easily stopped by
   most armour. It increases the damage level by 1, but the Power
   is lowered by either the ballistic armour of the target, or twice
   their impact, whichever is higher.

 o Gel
   Gel ammunition is non-lethal. They are designed to take down targets
   without killing them. The Power of all rounds fired is reduced by 2
   and do stun damage.
