DAMAGE

Damage in Shadowrun is dealt with in levels of varying degrees.
Imagine your total physical and mental health in terms of
percentages, with full health being 100% and each box representing
10%. 

All damage dealt is at one of four levels: light; moderate; serious;
or deadly. Light is 1 box of damage, moderate is 3, serious is 6 and
deadly is 10.

If you were to take a Moderate wound and then a Light wound you would
end up with 4 boxes of damage marked off. When you take damage it stays
the same type of damage you receive, either mental or physical, unless you
are at 0 mental, then it overflows into physical.

When you reach 0 mental or physical you fall unconcious (unless using a 
pain editor). If your physical health overflow is greater than your body,
you will die.
