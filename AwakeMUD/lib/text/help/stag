STAG

Stag is noble and swift, a spirit of life and death. Stag
represents the timeless cycle of birth, detah and rebirth
that encompasses all living things. He is detached from the
physical world but wise in the secret ways. Stag shamans are
proud and do not forget slights to their dignity, which they
must avenge in equal measure.
