PERCEIVE

Usage: ^gPERCEIVE^n

This command allows mages and shamans to perceive on the astral plane. They
remain in the physical plane, but they can see astral beings and mobs, and
defend themselves against astral attacks. Perceiving makes it harder to
concentrate on either plane of existance, leading to penalties in all actions
taken.
