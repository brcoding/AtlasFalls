LODGE

Lodges are where a Shaman performs powerful magic and both designs and learns
spells. They are bound to the shaman that created them and are dedicated to 
that shamans totem. Any shaman inside a lodge is protected by an astral barrier 
equal to the force of the lodge. It costs (force * 500) nuyen to build a lodge.

Only one lodge or hermetic circle can be present in a room at any given time.
