SMARTLINK "SMART GOGGLES"

The smartlink system consists of a cyberware component and a gun accessory.
It is designed to make shooting targets much easier, to reflect this all 
rounds fired from a smartlinked weapon get -2TN to hit. Smartlinks are not
compatible with laser sights.

Smart goggles are a non-cyberware alternative, however the bonus is only
half that off its cyberware equivelent.
