REFLECTION

Usage: ^gREFLECT <dice>^n

Reflection is a metamagic technique that reflects hostile spells
back onto the person that cast them. The more dice you have allocated
to your spell reflection pool the more chance you have of sending
the spell back where it came from.

If you have enough dice in the reflection pool you may also increase
the power of the spell before it strikes the original caster.
Reflection will never affect beneficial spells.
