LEAVE

Usage: ^gLEAVE
        LEAVE <apartment>^n

Leave is used mainly to leave vehicles, but will also make you leave an 
indoors room to the nearest outdoor area. You must first stop a vehicle
before you can leave it. To remove a vehicle from inside another vehicle
you use the leave command while driving.

This command is used when you no longer want to rent an apartment or other
living area. This will relinquish your hold on it and forfeit any paid
rent.
