RESTRING

Usage: ^gRESTRING <item> <new description>^n

This command is used to change the name of an item. Only the 
name is changed, the look description and room description stay
the same. You are charged 2.5 Karma per use of this command.

Be sure to only use one keyword to identify the original item or
any extra keywords after the first will become part of the new
description.

When restringing an item keep it as the same type as the item you
are restring it from. For example, restringing a suit of medium
military into a camo patterned suit of heavy armour is fine, but
restringing it into a black t-shirt is not.

All colours should be terminated with the ^N colour code to prevent
colour bleed into other messages.

Restringing into something unacceptable will forfeit your
ownership of the item.
