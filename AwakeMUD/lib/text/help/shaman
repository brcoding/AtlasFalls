CHEESE

Cheese is at home in musty old warehouses, where she spends
many years maturing and studying her art. Cheese requires
her followers to smell bad, causing them to become withdrawn,
which gives them more time to mature. Cheese is adept at the
arts of lactose intollerance, and all of her followers have
great power in commanding the power of lactose.

Cheese shamans prefer to not interact with anyone who is not
covered in wine, this includes talking to them on the phone.
How can they tell over the phone? Cheese just knows.
