"DERMAL PLATING"

Dermal plating involves surgically grafting material to the skin
in order to add more protection. While this works, it also makes
the person using it very grotesque. Higher rating Dermal Plating
just adds more plates to the skin. 

Dermal Plating adds to the body rating, but it only adds to damage
resistance tests. It does not add armour of any sort.
