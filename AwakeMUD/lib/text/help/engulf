ENGULF

Usage: ^gORDER <spirit> ENGULF <target>^n

This power causes the spirit/elemental to surround the target and
can cause great damage. The victim then has to strugle to break
free from the spirit/elemental's grasp or they will continue to
take damage every combat turn. Fire elementals who also have the
Flame Aura power activated cause extra damage with their engulf
attacks.
