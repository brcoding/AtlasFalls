PRIORITIES

All players have 5 priority slots, labelled from A to E (highest to lowest,
respectively), and 5 priorities: attributes, magic, race, resources, skills.
The higher an item is located on the priorities list the larger the gain in
that particular area will be. 

Full mages must take magic at priority A. Aspected mages or adepts can take
magic at priority B instead.

Race is automatically set during chargen depending on the race you choose.
