LOOK

Usage: ^gLOOK
       LOOK <target>
       LOOK IN <target>^n

This command is used to look at your surroundings. Look just displays
a view of the room, while looking at a target displays more details
about an object, person, direction, or vehicle. You will not see the
contents of an item unless you LOOK IN it.

Looking in a direction is also useful for finding hidden doors.
