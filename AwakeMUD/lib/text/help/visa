VISAS

Usage: ^gSHOW <visa>^n

This command is used to show your visa to guards to allow you to pass
through check points unhindered. This is required in some areas that
do not allow you to gain entry without valid ID. Getting ahold of a
valid Visa can often be time consuming and expensive, especially to get
one that can be used reliably.
