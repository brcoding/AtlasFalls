DESIGN

Usage: ^gDESIGN <part/program/spell>^n

This command creates a program design which helps with your
programming tests later in the development cycle. This takes
a number of hours equal to the program rating multiplied by
the program size multiplier. You must have the program
installed on a desktop computer and be sitting in the room
to use this. You must also have the applicable program
design skill.

This is also used to create a part design for building cyberdeck
components. Again, it helps your building test later in
the construction cycle. Not all parts requiring designing.

Also, it can be used to design spells. You need a lodge or
sorcery library (depending on your Tradition), in the room
with you to design a spell. It uses the Spell Design skill, but
you can use Sorcery with a penalty.
