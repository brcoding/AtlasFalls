"CONDITION MONITOR"

The condition monitor represents your physical and mental health.
As your damage in each stage in the scale, you get more and more
penalties added onto all your tests. Some spells and adept powers
can reduce the penalties, and total damage. But rest is the only
sure way to recover.
