COOK

Usage: ^gCOOK <program>^N

This command is used as the final step in programming anything. To use it
you need to have a complete program, a desktop computer, a chip cooker and
some optical chips. The value of optical chips you need is equal to the size
of the program in MP divided by 2. You don't need to monitor a cook operation,
you will be informed automatically when it is complete. Chips are removed with
the uninstall command.
