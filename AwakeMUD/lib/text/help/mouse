MOUSE

Mouse knows just where to find the right thing for every situation.
She is clever and resourceful; her wisdom often helps fierce and
proud totems like Lion and Wolf out of trouble, showing them the
common sense they might otherwise miss. Mouse is no one's enemy and,
if she has a flaw, it is that curiosity sometimes gets the better of
her. Mouse shamans tend to be hoarders, collecting all many of junk
along with useless information and trivia, storing everything away
for a rainy day.
