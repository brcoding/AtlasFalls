FISH

All glimmering scales and swift fins, Fish is quick and clever,
evading the fisherman's hook and the predator's jaws. In the east
he is Carp, while in the west he is often seen as wise Salmon, but
regardless of the mask he wears, Fish is wise. He can give much 
insight to those swift enough to catch him. Fish shamans love
secrets but loathe giving them away. They always bargain for the
best deal when parting with information.
