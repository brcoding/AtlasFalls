DEFAULT

Usage: ^gDEFAULT <program>^n

Default is used to make a program installed on a cyberdeck load into
active memory as soon as you connect to the matrix, making it available
straight away. Using default on a program already set to load as
default will unset the flag. Programs that are set to load by default
are followed by an asterisk in the ^wsoftware^n command.
