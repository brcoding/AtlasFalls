VCR "VEHICLE CONTROL RIGS"

Vehicle control rigs allow a rigger to engage in a full simsense link
with a mobile machine, such as a car, truck, panzer, helicopter, or
drone.  It is a form of cyberware which augments synaptic functions in
neural pathways, but only in the context of rigging.

Due to how VCRs change the neural pathways in the brain, and how the
brain grows around it, VCRs cause penalties to decking. You lose 1
hacking pool per VCR point plus the difficulty of all tests that take
place in the matrix is increased.
