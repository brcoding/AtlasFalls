REACH

Reach is a measurement of how far beyond normal you can reach out from
your body with your currently wielded weapon. Many melee weapons give
a bonus, as does having long arms, like a troll. Reach only affects
melee combat and has no bearing at all on ranged combat. Status will
show you how far you can reach beyond standard.
