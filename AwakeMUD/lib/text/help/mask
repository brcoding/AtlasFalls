MASK MASKING

Usage: ^gMASK <complete/initiation/dual>^n

Masking is a metamagic technique that helps hide various parts of your
aura. It is impossible for non-initiates to penetrate masking and it is
difficult for other initiates, unless of a higher grade than you, to
penetrate it also. 

You can hide either your Initiate status, the fact that you are dual natured
or perceiving or all of your magic. Other people will not see these things
unless they pass a difficult magic based test.

Masking helps a persona camouflage itself to its surroundings. It is
one of the most useful programs in a deckers arsenal. Coupled with
the Sleaze program it determines your detection factor. The higher your
detection factor is, the more difficulty the host has detecting your presence.

Your detection factor is the average of both your masking and sleaze
programs.
