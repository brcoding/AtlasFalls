Commands to take money out of the bank, put money in the bank, or see how
much money you have in the bank.  Because all ATMs are connected through the
Global Matrix, you may use any ATM no matter where your account is held.

credstick that has been personalized by you.

be logged on to receive it. All transfers are accompanied with a mail telling
them how much you have sent.

Example:
^c< 10P 10M > wire 5000 che^n

That would send the player name Che 5000 nuyen.
