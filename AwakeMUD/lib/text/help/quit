QUIT

When you get tired of playing, you can leave the game by typing 'quit'.
When you quit, you will automatically be placed in rent at the last
place you rented. Newbies who have never rented before are rented at the
Guild Hotel.

Quitting inside a house will make you load in that house next time you
log on, wether the house is yours or not.
