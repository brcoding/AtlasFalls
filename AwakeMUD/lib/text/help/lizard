LIZARD

Lizard often seems lethargic, enjoying the warmth of the sun
as he basks under the open sky. If necessary, he can move with
great speed and fight with unsurpassed viciousness. Lizard is
placid and slow to anger, except when his home or his freedom
are threatened. Lizard sees much in his stillness and is very
wise.
