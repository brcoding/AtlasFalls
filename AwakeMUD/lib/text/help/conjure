CONJURE

Usage: ^gCONJURE <force> <spirit/elemental>^n

Mages and shamans have the ability to conjure spirits and elementals
to do their bidding. Only mages can conjure elementals and only
shamans can conjure spirits. 
To conjure an elemental a mage must be in a room with a conjuring library
and a hermetic circle of force equal to or greater than the force of the
elemental they wish to conjure. Once conjured the elemental will owe the
mage a certain amount of services, and can be sent back to the metaplanes
to await the mage calling on them again. Conjuring an elemental takes time
a number of hours equal to the force of the elemental. The mage also needs
conjuring materials of a force equal to the force of the elemental.
Shamans can conjure spirits at anytime, but only of the domain they are in.
Drain from conjuring is reduced by Charisma.
