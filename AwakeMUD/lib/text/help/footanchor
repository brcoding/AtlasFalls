FOOT ANCHOR

This piece of cyberware extends a heavy-duty spur through the heel
of the users foot and embeds itself into the ground. It is dual
purpose, it can be used to anchor the user to the ground, giving
extra recoil compensation or it can be used as a weapon.
While it is extended the user cannot dodge or run as fast.
