WIRED REFLEXES

Wired reflexes is a type of cyberware that completly replaces the
nervous system of the person it is implanted in. It offers bonuses
to reaction and initiative, but causes the target to become twitchy
and often they react before having time to think. Users of wired
reflexes can also become agitated by how slow other people seem to
move, but all of the down sides can be offset by a reflex trigger.
