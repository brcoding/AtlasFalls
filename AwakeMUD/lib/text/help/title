TITLE PRETITLE

Usage: ^gTITLE <new title>^n
       ^gPRETITLE <new pretitle>^n

Sets the title people see on the ^WWHO^n list. You can't use parentheses 
(the "(" and ")" characters) because those are reserved for ^Wflags^n.
This command can be used at any time, even in chargen, to remove the
default newbie flag.

Once you reach 100TKE (Roughly Reputation + Notoriety) you will be able
to set a pretitle. This goes before your name and is commonly used to
display group affiliations.

Do not abuse this command; if you do, it will be taken from you.
