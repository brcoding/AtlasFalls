Get is used to retrieve an item from a location into your inventory.
The normal numbers (1.object, 2.object, etc) and all (all.object) work
with it for getting from the ground or a container. It is also used to
retrieve items from cyberware compartments.

If you have more than one item sharing a name you can access the
items past the first by using 2.itemname, 3.itemname etc.
