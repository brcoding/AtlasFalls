SPIDER

Spider is the great weaver, the builder of all things. Her
web links everything, showing what was and what will be. She
is eternal change, the cycle of life and death, the center
of all things. Her smile is both benevolent and fearsome, 
according to the time and her mood. She waits patiently, for
intime, all things come to her.
