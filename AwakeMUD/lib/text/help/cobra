COBRA

Cobra is stealthy and dangerous, hypnotizing her prey to bring
them close. She is slow to make choices, but her moves are
deliberate and she does not compromise. She deals on her own terms
and does not like being surprised. Cobra cannot fight to stun. She
will either abstain from fighting or go straight for the kill.
