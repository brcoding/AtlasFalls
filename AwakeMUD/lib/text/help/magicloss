"MAGIC LOSS"

Magic can be permanently lost in many different ways. Cyber and
Bioware are the most common way. Every point of cyberware, and
every 2 points of bioware reduce your magic rating by 1 point.
Any fraction of a point lost in this manner is the same as losing
a whole point.

It is also possible to lose magic through excessive use of stim
patches. Banishing powerful spirits is also another method, if
the spirit wins the contest it has a chance to lower your magic.
Foci addiction is another common method, if you are ever using
more force points of foci than twice your natural magic rating 
you risk permanently losing magic.
