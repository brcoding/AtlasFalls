EMOTE :

Usage: ^gEMOTE <string>
       :<string>^n

Show people what you're feeling.  The shorthand is ":".

It will display your name, then the string.  For example,
if your name is "Root":

^c< 10P 10M > emote is feeling very sad today.^n

will display:

Root is feeling very sad today.

Also preceeding a persons name by an '@' symbol will use the
MUDs internal name rendering, so other people will see the person
by the name they have remembered them as. For example:

^c< 10P 10M > emote gives @DJ a cookie.^n

will display to people who have DJ remembered as DJ:

Root gives DJ a cookie.

but will display to people who don't have DJ remembered as:

Root gives a tall, dark haired human male a cookie.
