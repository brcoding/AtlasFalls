PROGRAMS PERSONAS

All Deckers must have certain programs just for their deck to run. Programs
are much like the skeleton of the Deck, without them one cannot jack in.

There are four programs: Bod, Evasion, Masking and Sensors.

Only Bod and Sensors are needed to start up a cyberdeck. But trying to run
on the matrix without Evasion and Masking is very difficult.

The total ratings of all four programs cannot exceed three times the ^WMPCP^n
of the deck.
