BULL

Others both admire and fear Bull for his prowess, glad of his
presence as a defender but wary of his ambition. Proud Bull
never forgets a slight or an insult. He is generous to those he 
cares for and hostile to those who might harm them. As a leader,
Bull is often required to render judgement, and his judgement is
sometimes harsh.
  Bull shamans never forget any insult or slight and must avenge
it in equal measure. Bull cannot support any cause he knows is 
unjust.
