ENTER

Usage: ^gENTER <direction/vehicle> [rear]^n

Enter is used mainly to enter vehicles. A vehicle must be unlocked
and have enough available seats to allow you to enter it. It can
also be used outside to enter the first inside room. 

If you append the word "rear" to the end of the command when trying
to enter a vehicle you will enter the rear of the vehicle. There is
more room in the rear of a vehicle to store items and carrying people,
but you cannot drive or rig a vehicle from the back.

Enter can also be used while driving a vehicle to drive it inside of
another vehicle.

To access your vehicle in a long list of cars use the prefix 'my.'.

Example:

^c< 10P 10M > enter my.westwind^n
