QUICKNESS

Quickness represents your ability to move quickly (obvious, neh?) and dodge
things. Quickness is a major component in calculating combat pool. Quickness 
also affects your ^Wreaction^n, allowing you to get more attacks per round.
If you are a ^Wdecker^n, quickness also affects your hacking ability.
