ADDPOINT

Usage: ^gADDPOINT^n

This command is used by adepts to purchase an additional powerpoint.
This is seperate from an initiation as it does not increase the adepts
grade. There is no refund possible for this.

Extra power points cost 20 karma, and you can only buy 1 for every 50
reputation you have earned.
