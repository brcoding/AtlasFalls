BIOWARE

Usage: ^gBIOWARE^n

Bioware is a type of organically grown equipment, much like Cyberware only
it does not have an essence cost. There are various items of Bioware around
in the game, all having strange side affects and advantages. All metahumans
can take a maximum of 9 points of bioware. Howver, once it begins to exceed your
essence index you suffer severe penalties, such as slower healing, less overflow
and lower resistance to drugs and pathogens.

Bioware is notoriously incredibly expensive.
