BOAR

Strong and aggressive, Boar defends his home ferociously. He rarely
attacks without good reason, but once roused he will not yield until
he has driven the enemy far from his territory. Neither clever nor
subtle, Boar uses violence in combat rather than strategy. If someone
invades a Boar shaman's territory, he must attack. This might involve
a Boar shaman socially or verbally attacking somone who invades his
personal space or physically attacking annintruder in the shaman's
home or lodge.
