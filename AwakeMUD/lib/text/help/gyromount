GYROMOUNT

Gyromounts are pieces of equipment that are used to offset recoil penalties
from heavy weapons. They attach to your waist and to the gun and help brace it.
The use of a gyromount cuts your combat pool in half.

To use a gyromount simply wear it, and then wield the weapon. They are automatically
attached.
