"LIVING FOCUS"

Usage: ^gFOCUS
       FOCUS RELEASE^n

This adept power is used to sustain a single spell that has been cast
on the adept by a hermetic or shamanic mage. For the mage, this functions
the same as using a focus or spirit to sustain in that they receive no
penalty. The adept, however, receives the penalties for sustaining the
spell. The mage can still release the spell at any time.
