REFLEX

Usage: ^gREFLEX
       REFLEX off
       REFLEX <level>^n

Reflex is used to set your reflex trigger to certain levels, used to set
the maximum level your wired reflexes operate at. Standard triggers can
only be toggled by using reflex by itself, but stepped ones can be set to
any value less than the maximum rating of the wired reflexes.
