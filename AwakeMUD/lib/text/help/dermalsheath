"DERMAL SHEATHING"

Dermal Sheathing is an advanced form of Dermal Plating that is
less bulky and not as obvious. It adds more of a bonus than
Dermal Plating, as though it is operating at one rating higher.

Dermal Sheathing adds to the body rating, but it only adds to damage
resistance tests. It also adds half of its rating rounded up to impact
armour.
