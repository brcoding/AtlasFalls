TRAIN

Usage: ^gTRAIN <attribute>^n

This allows you to train, using karma to raise your attributes. When you find
a trainer, simply type train to see how much karma you can spend. Each usage 
can raise an attribute by one point. If you can afford any more, you
can find out by typing train again. For all chars, a racial maximum exists,
such that you cannot increase any natural stat above this value. Each
maximum differs with race, thus the advantages of each race.

This command is also used to train adept powers, listed next to each power
is the cost in powerpoints it will cost to train the adept power to the next level.

Also it is used to train metamagic techniques after you have selected them at
initiation. This takes a small amount of nuyen which is random, depending on
your magic rating, and the teachers magic rating.
