DOLPHIN

Dolphin is the free spirit of the sea, dancer on the waves. She is wise,
yet playful, and a friend of man. Dolphin helps people against the threats
of the sea (like Shark). Dolphin shamans are staunch protectors and helpers.
They cannot turn down a deserving person who needs their help and must
fight against evil that threatens people or natures.
