Phones, be they cellular, cybernetic, home or office phone 
or public, all serve the same purpose as they do in real life.  
Public phones function as the others, except you can not turn 
them on or off, turn on or off the ringer, or dial into them 
from another phone.  You must be carrying a phone, have a commlink 
(cybernetic phone) installed, or be in a public phone to use 
these commands.

Typing ^Rphone^n by itself will display the currently set options
for the phone, the phones number, and the number of the phone either
trying to connect to your phone or connected (a caller ID function).

You can toggle whether the phone makes noise by using either ^Rphone ring^n
or ^Rphone silent^n.

Call is used to initiate a phonecall with another phone. Type in the
number as it appears in the phone command but without dashes.
