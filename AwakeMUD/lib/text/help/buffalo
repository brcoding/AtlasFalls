BUFFALO

Buffalo is a uniquely North American totem. She knows much medicine, which she
uses to aid her people. She is kind and giving, strong and tireless in her work.
The people take from Buffalo and honour her spirit for the bounty she provides.
Buffalo shamans are healers and protectors; they cannot turn down an honest
request for aid from anyone who needs it. A Buffalo shaman will lay down her life
for a true friend or ally in need and will often take great risks to help others.
