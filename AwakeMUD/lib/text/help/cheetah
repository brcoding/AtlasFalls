CHEETAH

Cheetah is a swift-moving warrior. She cares little for subtlety,
preferring the most direct route to any goal. A master of many
skills, Cheetah seems never at a loss. Cheetah shamans prefer to
acquire a certain level of competence at a wide range of skills.
A Cheetah shaman prides herself on her competence and hates to
admit she is incapable of any task.
