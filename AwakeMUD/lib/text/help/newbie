NEWBIE NEOPHYTE 

Usage: ^gNEWBIE <message>^n

As a newbie, you will first of all need to find a source of survival 
in the Sprawl, namely food, water, and a gun. For directions on how 
to find some small suppliers of such resources, look at the map help 
files. To get a broader overview of other help files, type '^WIndex.^n'
Around the world of Awake, you will find numerous computer terminals, 
which link up to the worldwide neural network, displaying comments and 
information from other people in the Sprawl like yourself.

While you are still a newbie you will not suffer any penalties from 
dying besides losing the run you are currently on. Once you lose the 
newbie flag though you face stat loss and gear loss upon death. Also,
you are restricted from training until after you lose newbie status to
allow you to get a better feel for the system before spending karma.

Newbie status ends at 26 Total Karma Earned (Reputation + Notoriety). 
Once newbie status has ended you can no longer gain access to the guild
or the Newbie channel.

The ^WNEWBIE^n command is used to access the newbie channel. This channel 
is only visible to newbie characters, newbie helpers and immortals.
This is to be used for questions pertaining to the MUD only, not as a 
general discussion channel.
