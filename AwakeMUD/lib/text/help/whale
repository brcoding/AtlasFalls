WHALE

Whale appreciates beauty and the importantace of tradition,
and she holds personal honour dearer than all else. Loyal
to those she adopts, Whale protects them with her life if
necessary. Though slow to anger, her rage is terrible to
behold. Whale shamans do not start fights -- but they do
finish them. A Whale shaman cannot break any oath, knowing
her totem will punish her by withdrawing her magic. Of
course, a smart Whale shaman knows the best way to avoid
breaking an oath is not to make one.
