CAMERA PHOTO

Usage: ^gPHOTO <person/object>
       PHOTO^n

This command uses a camera to take a photo of a person, object or scene.
It will display everything as though you had looked at the object and
preserve it for future viewings. People with the invisibility spell will
show up on cameras whether you can see them or not. Eye cameras require
headware memory to operate correctly.
