"PLATELET FACTORY"

Platelet factories increase the bodys production of platelets to 
help wounds clot quicker, lowering damage for physical wounds.
The large amount of platelets present in the blood can lead to
serious complications however, such as heart attack or aneurysms.
To offset this anticoagulants (such as aspirin) must be taken once
per MUD day. Failure to do this can cause you to suffer heart failure
and die.
