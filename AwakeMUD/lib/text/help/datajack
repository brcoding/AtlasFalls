DATAJACKS

Datajacks are an important piece of cyberware if you are a decker or a
rigger. It allows a full simsense interface with either a computer system, 
or a machine such as a drone or automobile. Deckers and riggers are required 
to have this piece of cyberware.

There are 3 types of Datajack available. Standard datajacks are sockets implanted
in the head, normally behind the ear or in the temple. 

Induction datajacks are pads placed under the palm of the hand and linked to the 
brain. They are used by placing the palm over a specially designed pad that is
included when you buy the induction datajack. They are generally invisible.

Eye datajacks are implanted into cybereyes and require a total replacement of
one eye. When not in use the datajack is completly invisible but when used the
sight in the one eye is lost, causing loss of depth perception.
