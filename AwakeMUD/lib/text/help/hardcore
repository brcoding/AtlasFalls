HARDCORE

Usage: ^gTOGGLE HARDCORE^n

Hardcore Mode is an enforcement of Permanent Death. This flag
can only be toggled in Character Generation and once toggled on
it cannot be removed. If you become mortally wounded in this mode
and are not picked up by DocWagon then you are dead for good.

Hardcore characters are also protected from idle deletion, and a
Top 10 list of the most experienced Hardcore Character will soon
be available.
