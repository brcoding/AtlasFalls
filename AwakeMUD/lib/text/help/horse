HORSE

Swift and strong, Horse is the embodiment of freedom. She
roams across the land and cannot bear confinement. Though
never willful or malicious, Horse can be unpredictable. Horse
is also a figure of fertility, ensuring growth and prosperity
to the land. Horse dislikes open conflict and prefers to
avoid situations that limit her freedom. Horse shamans tend
to be slippery types who avoid long-term commitment.
