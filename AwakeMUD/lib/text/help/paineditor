"PAIN EDITOR"

Usage: ^gACTIVATE PAIN EDITOR^n

A Pain editor is one of the more powerful pieces of bioware available.
When activated it totally removes all sensation of pain. Someone hit
by a bullet with a pain editor activated wouldn't even notice it until
they saw the wound with their own eyes. All penalties from mental damage
are removed, and if you reach 0 mental condition you will not fall
unconcious, however damage will still overflow into physical. Being reduced
to 0 physical condition will still render you mortally wounded however.

When the pain editor is activated it grants a willpower bonus, but reduces
intelligence and make tactile perception very difficult. When deactivated
all penalties from the wounds suffered are applied instantly, including
unconciousness from mental damage.
