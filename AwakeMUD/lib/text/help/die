DIE DYING DEATH

Usage: ^gDIE^n

Die is used to force yourself to die when you are mortally wounded.
Death is not an end however, if you have a DocWagon Modulator they may
come and pick you and your gear up and take you to the nearest clinic.
If you don't have one however, don't fret, DocWagon will still come, they
just won't put as much effort into saving you. You will lose your gear and
the current run you are on.

Whenever you die, if your Modulator is triggered or not, you face the risk
or losing a point of a random attribute (besides charisma). This is not
permanent however and can be trained up as normal.
