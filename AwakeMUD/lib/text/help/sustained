"SUSTAINED SPELLS"

Sustained spells are a type of spell whos affects last over
a long period of time. While the spell is in affect the caster
must concetrate on it, which leads to TN penalties in all actions.
These penalties are per spell, and stack.

These penalties can be nullified by having a focus or elemental
sustain the spell for them.
