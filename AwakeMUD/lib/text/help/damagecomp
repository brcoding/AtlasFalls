"DAMAGE COMPENSATOR"

Damage compensators are a form of bioware that work like the pain
resistance spell and adept power. It helps you override the worst
effects of damage, like TN and initiatve penalties, up to the rating
of the damage compensator. However, unlike the spell and adept power
it will hide your actual damage from you, leaving you at a loss of
information when deciding wether to retreat or not.
