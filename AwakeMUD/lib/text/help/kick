KICK

Usage: ^gKICK <door> [direction]^n

This command is used to break down a door using your feet. Your
strength attribute is used to calculate the power of the attack.
Not all doors can be kicked down. The hit command can be used
instead of kick if you want to use your currently wielding weapon
to break down the door.
