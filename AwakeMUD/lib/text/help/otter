OTTER

Otter is playful and mischievous. She knows her territory
well, all its secret places for fishing and hiding. Otter is
clever and can outwit bigger creatures. At home on land or in
water, she watches everything with a careful eye. Otter is a
prankster with a strange sense of humour. Otter shamans are
always full of nervous energy and have difficulty sitting
still for long periods of time.
