CUSTOMIZE

Usage: ^gCUSTOMIZE <reflection/persona/physical/background>^n

This allows you to customize the three descriptions you may have in Awake: your
Astral Reflection, your physical appearance, and your Matrix Persona. With
this command, you can customize all of their characteristics. You can also use
it to write a character background. This is visible only to imms and may come
into use during imm runs.

^C1) Alias:^n
This is for the keywords that will work for interaction with others in
the same room as you.  Always make sure your name is one of the aliases
in the list.

^C2) Short Description:^n
This is what you will appear as, the 'name' of you in the room.  This is
not the same as your character name, in fact it is preferred to be
something descriptive of your character, like for example:

^cA hairy stout elf with yellow eyes^n

^C3) Room Description:^n
This is what people will see when they glance in a room that you are
present in.  Like for example:

^cA hairy elf covered in tattoos is standing here.^n

If you are customizing your physical description, this is replaced with
voice. For example:

^cA deep throaty male voice^n

^C4) Look Description:^n
This is the description people will see when they look directly at you.
We suggest you go crazy with your creativity and make a nice description
that covers many details about your character.

To end the description editors, you simply type '@' alone on
the last line.  To exit the customize menu type 'q' to quit.

^C5) Arriving Text:^n
This is the text that people see when you arrive in a room. The format is:
^c<Short Description> <Arriving Text> the <Direction>^n 
For Example a leaving description of:
^ccasually strolls from^n
Would display the message:
^cA hairy elf covered in tattoos casually strolls from the north.^n

^C6) Leaving Text:^n
This is the text that people see when you leave a room. The format is:
^c<Short Description> <Leaving Text> <Direction>^n
For Example a leaving description of:
^csneaks^n
Would display the message:
^cA hairy elf covered in tattoos sneaks south.^n

^C6) Height:
7) Weight:^n
These are used to set your height and weight, you can choose the rough size
your character is and it will randomly generate the height and weight within
those limits. You cannot set this once you are out of Newbie status.
